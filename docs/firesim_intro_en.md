# When can I stop working?

**This is a simple simulation of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) concept.**
The simulation will calculate how long you need to work to retire early and live from your investments, given you invest the surplus of the cash.

Configure your current financial situation, that includes:
- the monthly income, net of taxes, the monthly expenses
- current investments, like: stocks, bonds, and cash.
- investment properties, if you have any.
- configure the expected return rates and inflation rate

**The simulation does not take into account the taxes and pension, just your actual savings**
